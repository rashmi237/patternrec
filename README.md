Lab 1 - This lab investigates three related areas: calculating orthonormal transformations, creating decision boundaries, and assessing classifcation error.

Lab 2 - This lab examines the areas of statistical model estimation and classifer aggregation. Model estimation will be performed by implementing parametric and non-parametric estimators. Aggregation is introduced by combining several simple linear discriminants into one more powerful classifer.
